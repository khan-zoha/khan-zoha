          <p id="iotP" hidden>
            Advisors: Dr. Naveed Bhatti and Dr. Hamad Alizai <br>
            Lab: Internet of Things <br>
            Idea: The study will concentrate on a Xiaomi IP camera and utilise data analysis of network packets and machine learning methods to identify human vs object motion using encrypted data blocks sent by the camera utilising the UDP and TCP protocols. The project entails utilising a "Alfa awus036nh" router's monitor mode to record and analyse the IP camera's network activity. The proposed initiative seeks to enhance the privacy and security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly IP cameras. <br>

            Advisors: Dr. Yasir Zaki (Professor at NYU), Dr. Talal Rahwan (Professor at NYU), Dr. Muhammad Fareed Zaffar (Professor at LUMS) <br>
            Lab: Data Science and AI Lab (NYU) <br>
            Idea: We aim to expose biases (e.g., racial, gender) within media channels and compare biases across channels with different polarities in terms of leftist and rightist behavior using Natural Language Processing. <br>
            • Scraped more than 1 million article content from New York Times and Fox News via Wayback machine, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup Library. <br>
            • Optimised text extraction from article links via joblib.parallel. <br>
            • Ran Word2Vec model on text corpus for past 10 years. <br>
            • Calculated relative percentage difference of cosine similarities of different ethnicities with respect to white people. <br>

            Advisors: Dr. Umar Iqbal (Postdoc - University of Washington), Dr. Muhammad Fareed Zaffar (Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University) <br>
            Lab: Security and Privacy Research Lab (University of Washington) <br>
            Idea: The goal is to measure the ad accessibility systematically to understand the experience of visually impaired users. <br>
            • Scraped ads using Puppeteer from 20K websites of the Tranco list via an open-source web crawler. <br>
            • Measured the frequency of accessibility tokens (e.g., aria-labels, alt-text, aria-live, and aria-hidden) by using html parser. <br>
            • Developed a basic Node-based Web Application to classify ad's labels (aria-label and alt-text) as sufficient, limited, or misinformation (dark patterns) against the ad's screenshots. <br>
            • Designed survey to understand perception, understanding, and expectations of visually impaired users from advertisements. <br>

            Lab: National Center of Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC, Pakistan) <br>
            Idea: The research aims to analyze the relationships between digital literacy and truth discernment, sharing intentions, emotional responses, and confirmation bias especially among low- and middle-income users. This can help in determining which social media users are most prone to fake news. <br>
            
            • Worked as team lead for the whole project. <br>
            • Conducted extensive literature review and designed the survey on KoboToolbox. <br>
            • Conducted a training session for other interviewees. <br>
            • Conducted a pilot field study of 200 in-person interviews. <br>
            • Performed data analysis and found that older individuals, females, those less educated, and people with lower household expenses are likely to have poor digital literacy.

          <p id="livevideoP" hidden>
            Advisors: Dr. Zaffar Ayub Qazi (Postdoc - UC Berkeley) <br>
            Idea: Our project's primary goal is to understand optimal user experience when it comes to watching live events within an online setting. <br>
            • Developed a MERN-based web application that serves the same stream at three distinct bitrates. <br>
            • Collected TV streams and used Open Broadcasting System to serve over RTMP protocol at a fixed bitrate to the server, which then used FFmpeg to convert the video to different bitrates.  <br>
            • Used a simple HTML video player to show the video to the user.  <br>
            • Results showed that a stream that facilitated a less frequent rebuffering rate and moderate quality was the most preferred.  <br>
